# ergonomize.css v1.0.0

[Version FR](https://github.com/Effeilo/ergonomize.css/blob/master/README-FR.md)

The purpose of ergonomize.css is to bring some additional rules to html elements that improve the user experience without altering their default styles.

## What can you expect ?

Ergonomize.css is fully documented, you will find detailed explanations inside the file but here are the main elements that it brings:

* Allow the user to better understand somes elements of the site.
* Optimize somes elements for responsive design.
* Improve ergonomics for mobile and tablets.
* Hyphenation.

## How to use it ?

* Download ergonomize.css.
* Remove the rules that is useless for you.
* Ideally place the code before the reset reload or after [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

## Contribute

Some things to keep in mind if you want to contribute:

* Only html elements are declared in ergonomize.css (no addition of classes).
* Ergonomize.css was thought to be complementary to [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), the rules are the least altering it.
* No formatting styles meet a theme.
